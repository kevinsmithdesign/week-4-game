# week-4-game

In this assignment I experienced with jQuery for the first time. I created a fun interactive game for the web browser.This time, the app dynamically updates your HTML page with the jQuery library. The game is called Crystal Collectors, rules below:

• There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

• The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

• When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

• Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
  When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
  The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

• The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

• The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

• When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden      values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

• The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. 

• The random numbers shown at the start of the game are between 19 - 120.

• Each crystal has a hidden value between 1 - 12.
